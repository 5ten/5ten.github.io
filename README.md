#skrollr-stylesheets-bootstrap
A bootstrap for initializing a skrollr-stylesheets project using HTML5 boilerplate, bourbon and bower

##Setup
####Compilation

Everything comes out of /sass/style.scss. Simply direct your tool to compile from sass/style.scss to css/style.css.

####CSS Architecture

The SASS folder is orgnaized according to a kind of BEM structure, with the skrollr styles partialed out into /skrollr.

Look at /skrollr/anchors.scss to see the bootstrapped anchor and frames/frame01/ to see the bootstrapped keyframes. In this case, I've just designed a div block to go from opacity 1 to 0 via the anchor target "#anchor01". If you have any questions or want help, please don't hesitate to email me.
