<h1>skrollr-stylesheets-bootstrap</h1>

<p>A bootstrap for initializing a skrollr-stylesheets project using HTML5 boilerplate, bourbon and bower
<br>
<br></p>

<h2>Setup</h2>


<h4>Compilation</h4>


<p>Everything comes out of /sass/style.scss. Simply direct your tool to compile from sass/style.scss to css/style.css.</p>


<p><br><br></p>

<h4>CSS Architecture</h4>


<p>The SASS folder is orgnaized according to a kind of BEM structure, with the skrollr styles partialed out into /skrollr.</p>


<p>Look at /skrollr/anchors.scss to see the bootstrapped anchor and frames/frame01/ to see the bootstrapped keyframes. In this case, I've just designed a div block to go from opacity 1 to 0 via the anchor target "#anchor01". If you have any questions or want help, please don't hesitate to email me.</p>
